Welcome to nozomi, the fastest way to get going on Rails.

nozomi is a simple wrapper for the `rails new` command
with a slight difference of opinions.

  * git for version control
  * rspec for testing
  * haml for templating
  * sass and compass for stylesheets
  * grid-coordinates for a flexible grid layout

When nozomi is done you'll have a git repo containing your app. 
Each step of the process is committed individually, so you'll know
exactly what nozomi did.

Just type

    nozomi <app_name>
