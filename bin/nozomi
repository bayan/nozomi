Welcome to nozomi, the fastest way to get going on Rails.

nozomi is a simple wrapper for the `rails new` command
with a slight difference of opinions.

  * git for version control
  * rspec for testing
  * haml for templating
  * sass and compass for stylesheets
  * grid-coordinates for an html grid

When nozomi is done you'll have a git repo with each step
of the process checked in a separate commit, so you'll know
exactly what nozomi did.

Just type

    nozomi <app_name>
